The rules for writing Roman numerals allow for many ways of writing each number. However, there is always a "best" way of writing a particular number.

For example, the following represent all of the legitimate ways of writing the number sixteen:

		IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
		VIIIIIIIIIII
		VVIIIIII
		XIIIIII
		VVVI
		XVI

The last example being considered the most efficient, as it uses the least number of numerals.

The 11K text file, roman.txt, contains one thousand numbers written in valid, but not necessarily minimal, Roman numerals; that is, they are arranged in descending units and obey the subtractive pair rule.

Find the number of characters saved by writing each of these in their minimal form.

Note: You can assume that all the Roman numerals in the file contain no more than four consecutive identical units.
